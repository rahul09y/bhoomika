  <h1>From Me to You</h1>
  <p>My final words... from the deepest part of me.</p>

  <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #ddd;">
    Bhoomika, <br/><br/>

    I know I hurt you, and no apology will ever erase the pain.<br/>
    But I hope you can feel the sincerity in my words and my actions now.<br/><br/>

    I never meant to take your love for granted. <br/>
    You were — and still are — one of the most beautiful parts of my life.<br/><br/>

    If there’s even a small corner in your heart that still cares...<br/>
    I’ll be there. Waiting. Hoping. Loving. Always.<br/><br/>

    Forever sorry,<br/>
    <b>Me</b>
